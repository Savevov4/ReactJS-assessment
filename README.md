#### 1. When using webpack, why would you need to use a loader ?
- to put together physical file folders
- to load external data &#10004;
- to load the website into everyone's phone
- to process files

#### 2. How do you fix the syntax error that results from running this code ?
```js
const person = (firstName, lastName) => 
        {
            first: firstName,
            last: lastName
        }
console.log(person("Jill", "Wilson"));
```
- Wrap the object in parentheses. &#10004;
- Call the function from another file.
- Replace the object with an array.
- Add a return statement before the first curly brace.
